### Coding Scenario: Personal Profile and Preferences

**Objective:** You are tasked with creating a Python script to represent and process personal profile information and preferences. This scenario will test your knowledge of strings, integers, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and boolean data types in Python.

#### Scenario Description:

Imagine you are designing a simple profile for a social media application. Each user profile contains basic personal information, a list of favorite hobbies, preferred screen dimensions for viewing the app, and a brief description of their pet.

#### Task Instructions:

1. **Personal Information**
   - Create a variable `name` (str) to store the user's name.
   - Create a variable `age` (int) to store the user's age.
   - Print a greeting message using these variables, e.g., `"Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."`

2. **Favorite Hobbies**
   - Create a list `favorite_hobbies` containing at least three hobbies as strings.
   - Add another hobby to this list and print the updated list.

3. **Screen Dimensions**
   - Define a tuple `screen_dimensions` with two integers representing the width and height of the user's preferred screen size for the app.
   - Attempt to modify one of the values in the tuple to simulate an attempt to change screen preferences and comment on the outcome.

4. **Pet Description**
   - Create a dictionary `pet` to describe the user's pet. It should include keys for `type`, `name`, `age`, and later, `color`.
   - Add a `color` key to the `pet` dictionary with an appropriate value and print the pet's name and color.

5. **Adult Status**
   - Determine if the user is an adult with a boolean variable `is_adult`. Consider someone an adult if they are 18 years old or more.
   - Using conditional logic, print `"I am an adult."` if true, and `"I am not an adult."` if false.
