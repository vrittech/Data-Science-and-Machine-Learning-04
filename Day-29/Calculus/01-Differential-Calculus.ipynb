    "# Differential Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential calculus is the study of rates at which quantities change. It is concerned with the study of slopes of curves, tangent lines, and the instantaneous rate of change of functions. This tutorial will cover the basic concepts and techniques of differential calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slope of a Line\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study of differential calculus, the slope of a straight line is an important concept. The slope of a straight line is defined as the ratio of the change in the y-coordinate to the change in the x-coordinate between any two points on the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two points on the line, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), then the slope of the line can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "slope = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula gives us the average rate of change of the y-coordinate with respect to the x-coordinate over the interval between the two points. In calculus, we use this concept of slope to study the behavior of functions and their derivatives. For example, the derivative of a function at a point represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point, which can be thought of as the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differentiability of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is said to be differentiable at a point if it has a derivative at that point. Geometrically, this means that the graph of the function has a well-defined tangent line at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if a function is differentiable at a point, we need to check if the limit of the difference quotient exists as the input approaches that point. The difference quotient is defined as the slope of the secant line between two points on the function, divided by the distance between those points. The limit of the difference quotient as the two points get closer and closer together is the derivative of the function at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a function f(x) is differentiable at a point x = a if the following limit exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where h is the difference between a and the input x, and the limit is taken as h approaches zero. If this limit exists, then the function is said to be differentiable at the point x = a.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function is differentiable at a point, it is also continuous at that point, but the converse is not necessarily true. A function may be continuous at a point without being differentiable at that point if the limit of the difference quotient does not exist or if it exists but is not equal to the slope of the tangent line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limit of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit of a function as the independent variable approaches a certain value is the value that the function approaches as the independent variable gets arbitrarily close to that value. Limits are used to define the derivative of a function."
