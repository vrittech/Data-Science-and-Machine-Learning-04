    "Suppose that Shila is visiting a zoo for the first time, and she does not know much about animals. While observing various animals, she sees some living in water, some with wings, some living in trees, and some underground. Although she does not precisely know what animals they are, she has observed some similarities and differences. With the similarity she noted, she was able to group various animals, as shown in the figure below.\n",

    "### Types of Clustering Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithm based on their clustering approaches can be divided into following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partitioning-Based Clustering:**  \n",
    "Partitioning based clustering algorithms work by subdividing the data sets into some number of clusters (_K_). The clusters are generally identified by the centroid points such as the mean. A data point belongs to a cluster whose centroid is closest to it, i.e. centroid with minimum distance. With partition based clustering, the data shown in the Figure 2(a) can be partitioned as,\n",

    "2. **Hierarchical Clustering:**   \n",
    "Hierarchical clustering is a connectivity-based clustering algorithm where either a bigger cluster is formed by connecting two similar smaller clusters, or two smaller clusters are formed by breaking a bigger cluster. This type of clustering creates a hierarchy of connectivity, hence called hierarchical clustering. Figure below shows a simple dataset where hierarchical clustering is applied.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Density-Based Clustering:**   \n",
    "In density-based clustering, a region of densely connected data points creates clusters. If there is more than one densely connected region, then there is more than one cluster. Density-based clustering does not assume the shape of the clusters. Hence, they can be of any form but separated by a sparse region.\n",

    "Above Figure 6(a) shows one-dimensional data points concentrated at two locations. In Figure 6(b), we have fitted two Gaussian distribution (one for each concentrated region) to represent the data. In density-based clustering, we use these two probability distributions as clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Grid-Based Clustering:**   \n",
    "Grid-based clustering divides the data space into a discrete space called grids. Then, the density of the data in each grid is used to classify it as noise or cluster. The clusters are then grouped based on neighboring locations to form the region of clusters and empty regions.\n",
